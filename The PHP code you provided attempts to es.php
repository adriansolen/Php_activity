The PHP code you provided attempts to establish a connection to a MySQL server using the `mysqli_connect` function. There are a few issues in the code that need to be addressed:

1. **Error Handling**: In the code, there is a mix of `mysqli` and `mysql` functions for error handling. It's better to stick with `mysqli` consistently. Here's how you can handle errors using `mysqli` functions:

   ```php
   $conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

   if (!$conn) {
       die('Could not connect to MySQL server: ' . mysqli_connect_error());
   }
   ```

   Using `mysqli_connect_error()` instead of `mysql_error()` will provide you with the specific error message from MySQL.

2. **Security**: It's not recommended to hardcode the database credentials directly in the PHP file. Consider storing sensitive information in a separate configuration file outside of the web root and include it in your PHP files.

   For example, create a file named `config.php` with the following content:

   ```php
   <?php
   $servername = 'localhost';
   $username = 'root';
   $password = '';
   $dbname = 'my_db';

   $conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

   if (!$conn) {
       die('Could not connect to MySQL server: ' . mysqli_connect_error());
   }
   ```

   Then, in your main PHP file, include the `config.php` file:

   ```php
   <?php
   include('config.php');
   // Rest of your code
   ```

   This way, your database credentials are not exposed directly in your main PHP file.

Make sure you have a valid MySQL server running on `localhost` with the specified database (`my_db` in this case) and the correct username and password. Fixing these issues should help you establish a successful connection to your MySQL server.
